- [] retrieve object with id from the realm database instead of query? doesn it even matter?


## Notes
- `.d.ts` files e.g. interfaces
- `npm install realm @realm/react`
```
(NOBRIDGE) ERROR  Error: Expo Go does not contain the native module for the 'realm' package. To use native modules outside of what is packaged in Expo Go, create a development build:

npx expo install expo-dev-client
npx expo run:ios
```

- make sure `ScrollView` imported from react native and not something else
- expo router >>> expo navigation

- REMEMBER to add component folder to tailwind configs for styles
